## Model documentation

This website was created by [Amy Heather](https://github.com/amyheather) [![ORCID 0000-0002-6596-347](images/ORCIDiD_icon16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6596-3479). It shares **model documentation** to support understanding of how the model works, and how you can use it. Please use the **sidebar** to navigate through the site pages.

The **Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM-RCC)** is a platform cost-effectiveness model encompassing each decision node in the disease area for advanced renal cell carcinoma. It has been constructed as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Pathways Pilot appraisal (ID6186, GID-TA11186) @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_renal_nodate and the appraisal of cabozantinib plus nivolumab (TA964) @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_cabozantinib_2024 (formerly ID6184, whilst in development). The development of this model is briefly described in Lee et al. 2024, @lee_nices_2024 but there will also be a monograph (currently with the journal): Lee, Muthukumar, Lovell, et al. Treatments for renal cell carcinoma [ID6186]: A NICE Pilot Treatment Pathways Appraisal, HTA Monograph [Submitted].

If you are interested in discussing or funding further development of this model, please contact the PenTAG team at `pentag@exeter.ac.uk`.

Other resources related to this model include:

* [Web application](https://amyheather.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/): The ambition for EOM:RCC is to create a shiny interface that allows users to interact and run the full economic model from a web application. A pilot example web app has been created which allows users to run one part of the analysis: creating a table of possible treatment sequences.
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nice-digital/NICE-model-repo): All code for the model, documentation and app are contained in this repository. The `README.md` file (which is displayed when you open the repository on GitHub) provides key information about the model and repository.
