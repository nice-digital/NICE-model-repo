The **Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM:RCC)** is a platform cost-effectiveness model encompassing each decision node in the disease area for advanced renal cell carcinoma.

It has been constructed as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Pathways Pilot appraisal (ID6186, GID-TA11186) @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_renal_nodate and the appraisal of cabozantinib plus nivolumab (TA964) @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_cabozantinib_2024 (formerly ID6184, whilst in development). The development of this model is described in Lee et al. 2024. @lee_nices_2024
