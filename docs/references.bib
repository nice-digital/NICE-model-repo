	abstract = {Clinical endpoints are essential for assessing the safety and efficacy of new cancer therapies. They are used by oncologists to help guide clinical decision making. While overall survival (OS) has frequently been regarded as the “gold standard” primary clinical endpoint, it’s utility is constrained by several disadvantages. The time-consuming nature of trials using OS has led to a recent push to explore surrogate clinical endpoints and their potential to serve as primary clinical endpoints in lieu of OS. Additionally, it is becoming evident that other endpoints add valuable information about quality of life and treatment failure as their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in oncology clinical trials. Without a doubt, the use of clinical endpoints will continue to expand and evolve as new cancer therapies are developed and novel treatments, including immunotherapy, draw interest. This review explores the roles of primary and surrogate clinical endpoints as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each specific endpoint. In addition, it directly compares the unique features of each suggesting some of the specific uses each one fulfills.},

	abstract = {Background
The methods used to estimate health-state utility values (HSUV) for multiple health conditions can produce very different values. Economic results generated using baselines of perfect health are not comparable with those generated using baselines adjusted to reflect the HSUVs associated with the health condition. Despite this, there is no guidance on the preferred techniques and little research describing the effect on cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) results when using the different methods.
Methods
Using a cardiovascular disease (CVD) model and cost per QALY thresholds, we assess the consequence of using different baseline health-state utility profiles (perfect health, no history of CVD, general population) in conjunction with models (minimum, additive, multiplicative) frequently used to approximate scores for health states with multiple health conditions. HSUVs are calculated using the EQ-5D UK preference-based algorithm.
Results
Assuming a baseline of perfect health ignores the natural decline in quality of life associated with age, overestimating the benefits of treatment. The results generated using baselines from the general population are comparable to those obtained using baselines from individuals with no history of CVD. The minimum model biases results in favor of younger-aged cohorts. The additive and multiplicative models give similar results.
Conclusion
Although further research in additional health conditions is required to support our findings, our results highlight the need for analysts to conform to an agreed reference case. We demonstrate that in CVD, if data are not available from individuals without the health condition, HSUVs from the general population provide a reasonable approximation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jval.2010.10.029},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decision analytic models in health care require baseline health-related quality of life data to accurately assess the benefits of interventions. The use of inappropriate baselines such as assuming the value of perfect health (EQ-5D = 1) for not having a condition may overestimate the benefits of some treatment and thus distort policy decisions informed by cost per quality adjusted life years thresholds.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine if data from the general population are appropriate for baseline health state utility values (HSUVs) when condition specific data are not available.
METHODS: Data from four consecutive Health Surveys for England were pooled. Self-reported health status and EQ-5D data were extracted and used to generate mean HSUVs for cohorts with or without prevalent health conditions. These were compared with mean HSUVs from all respondents irrespective of health status.
RESULTS: More than 45\% of respondents (n = 41,174) reported at least one condition and almost 20\% reported at least two. Our results suggest that data from the general population could be used to approximate baseline HSUVs in some analyses, but not all. In particular, HSUVs from the general population would not be an appropriate baseline for cohorts who have just one condition. In these instances, if condition specific data are not available, data from respondents who report they do not have any prevalent health condition may be more appropriate. Exploratory analyses suggest the decrement on health-related quality of life may not be constant across ages for all conditions and these relationships may be condition specific. Additional research is required to validate our findings.},
