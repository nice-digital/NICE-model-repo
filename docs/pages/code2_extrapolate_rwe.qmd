## Adjustments

Changes from `Model_Structure.R`:

* Load global environment from prior page (as have split up `Model_Structure.R`)
* Amend path to `.xlsx` file using d_path

:::

```{r}
#| output: false
#| echo: false

# Re-run the previous page, as we need that environment before continuing,
# and it was too large to save.image() and load as an .RData file
# include: code1_setup.qmd
```
