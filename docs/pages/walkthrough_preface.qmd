## Aim of the walkthrough

The following pages will provide a walk-through for running the Base Case EOM:RCC model, including an explanation of the:

* **Input data**
* **Code in `Model_Structure.R`**
* **Output report**

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

## Bonus information

These drop-down boxes appear throughout the walkthrough, and contain additional code to help walk you through what is happening (for example, explaining a function or section of code).

:::

## Adjustments

In order to run the code from `Model_Structure.R` within this documentation, **minor adjustments** have been made such as to:

* Amend file paths
* Include additional pre-run results, enabling:
  * Quicker run times
  * The code to be split across multiple pages

Hence, it is advised that you use the original R script when running the model for yourself, rather than these `.qmd` files.

## Adjustments

These drop-down boxes will appear at the start of each page, explaining how the code copied over from `Model_Structure.R` has been amended for the purposes of the walkthrough.
