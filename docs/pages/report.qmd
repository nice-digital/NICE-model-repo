## Viewing the report

The output report will be in `.docx` format, so this is best viewed within Microsoft Word. If viewed in LibreOffice, you may find the tables are misformatted (going outside the page margins so not visible). If viewed in Google Docs, you may find the figures are not visible/fail to correctly load.
