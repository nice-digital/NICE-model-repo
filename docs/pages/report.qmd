## Walkthrough of report sections

### Table 1

### Table 2

![Table 2: Application of the severity modifier to the base case](../images/example_tab2.png){.lightbox}

### Table 3 to 5

These tables present the life years (LY) gained by health state. They compare two treatment strategies marked X and Y.

Table 3 compares Cabozantinib plus nivolumab against Pazopanib for the all risk group.

Table 4 is for the favourable risk group and also compares against Pazopanib, whilst Table 5 is for the intermediate/poor risk group and the comparator is Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.

### Tables 6 to 8

## Viewing the report

The output report will be in `.docx` format, so this is best viewed within Microsoft Word. If viewed in LibreOffice, you may find the tables are misformatted (going outside the page margins so not visible). If viewed in Google Docs, you may find the figures are not visible/fail to correctly load.
