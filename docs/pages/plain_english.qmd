The analysis in this repository forms part of a technology appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The purpose of an appraisal is to help inform whether the NHS should fund a new treatment. This is based on the cost-effectiveness of a treatment, as determined by comparing the health outcomes and costs resulting from this treatment, compared with another treatment.

This appraisal evaluates a combination of two treatments: **cabozantinib with nivolumab**. It assesses whether these are cost-effective as a first-line treatment (i.e. the first treatment given for a disease, in otherwise untreated patients).

It is being evaluated in patients with **renal cell carcinoma (RCC)** which is a type of kidney cancer. Specifically, it focuses on patients with advanced RCC, which means the cancer has spread from their kidney to other areas of their body.

## What does the analysis do?

This diagram provides a broad summary of the steps required to perform this cost-effectiveness analysis. These are described in further detail below.

![Basic overview of the analysis](../images/basic_overview.drawio.png){.lightbox}

## Part 1. Relative efficacy of each treatment

relative efficacy

one versus other

focus on x y z outcomes

based on clinical trial data

which trials

compare things that haven't otherwise been compared

## Part 2. Get patient outcomes over time for reference treatment

real world evidence

extrapolation

## Part 3. Estimate outcomes over time for each treatment

apply relative efficacy to those curves

## Part 4. Get data on the cost and health utility of patients

why, where from

## Part 5. Construct an economic model

proportion of people

data from above

simulate people receiving each treatment, their outcomes, their costs

can then compare treatments
