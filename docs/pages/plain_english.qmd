## Advanced renal cell carcinoma

**Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)** is a type of **kidney cancer**. It is the most common type, accounting for over 80% of cases. The treatment strategy depends on RCC's location and stage. The stages of RCC can be defined as:

* Stage 1 and 2 (cancer is only in the kidney)
* Stage 3 (cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes)
* Stage 4 (cancer has metastasised, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body)

Stage 4 RCC is also known as **advanced RCC (aRCC)**.
