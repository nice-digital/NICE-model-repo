**TBC. This page is a work in progress**

This repository contains code to support appraisal of the cost-effectiveness of treatments in advanced renal cell carcinoma. It is currently applied to an appraisal of cabozantinib and nivolumab. This application and an overview of the analysis and modelling steps performed are described below.

## Background

### Renal cell carnioma stages and risk groups

**Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)** is a type of **kidney cancer**. It is the most common type, accounting for over 80% of cases. The treatment strategy depends on RCC's location and stage. The stages of RCC can be defined as:

| Stage 1 and 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 4 |
| - | - | - |
| Cancer is only in the kidney | Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes | Cancer has metastasised, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body; Also known as **advanced RCC (aRCC)** |

People with aRCC who have not yet received systemic treatments (therapies that target cancer cells throughout the body) are classified as either being **favourable-risk** RCC or **intermediate- and poor-risk** RCC. These categories are defined in the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria. They are established based on time from diagnosis, the patient's ability to perform daily tasks, and some laboratory measurements. In the UK, most RCC patients are classified as intermediate or poor risk. Risk status is associated with clinical outcomes (for example, mortality rates). It is used to help guide decisions on which treatments to use.

For more information, see section 2.2 Epidemiology and 2.3.1 Risk Status in the Assessment Report. @lee_treatments_2023-1

### Focus of the appraisal

The analysis in this repository is related to the NICE appraisal TA964 @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_cabozantinib_2024 which assesses the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of **cabozantinib with nivolumab** as a **first-line therapy** for patients with **aRCC**.

This treatment is a combination of:

* Cabozantinib - oral, 40mg daily
* Nivolumab - intravenous, 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks

It is a first-line (1L) systemic therapy, meaning it is for previously untreated patients. They may then have up to 3 more treatments (referred to as second-line (2L), third-line (3L) and fourth-line (4L) therapies), or at any point, may instead transition to receiving best-supportive care (BSC).

The appraisal compares this treatment **against other 1L treatments**. When modelling this, it includes a simulation of the subsequent treatments that people might receive after each.

For more information, see section 3.2 Interventions and 3.3 The RCC treatment pathway in the Assessment Report. @lee_treatments_2023-1

## Stage 1. Estimating the relative efficacy of each treatment

This stage aims to get data on the **relative efficacy** of each available treatment for aRCC at 1L to 4L, which is based on evidence from clinical trials.

### Identification of randomised controlled trials

A systematic review was conducted to identified **randomised controlled trials (RCTs)** of patients with aRCC who received any of the treatments under comparison - namely: cabozantinib plus nivolumab; pazopanib; tivozanib; sunitinib; cabozantinib; nivolumab plus ipilimumab; pembrolizumab and lenvatinib; axitinib; lenvatinib plus everolimus; everolimus; nivolumab; avelumab plus axitinib

The studies had to report at least one of the outcomes of interest:

* **Overall survival (OS)** - "time from randomisation to death" @delgado_clinical_2021
* **Progression-free survival (PFS)** - "time from randomisation until first evidence of disease progression or death" @delgado_clinical_2021
* **Time to next treatment (TTNT)** - "time from initiating treatment to initiating the next line of therapy" @delgado_clinical_2021
* **Time on treatment** - similar to TTNT, but excluding time off treatment between lines of therapy
* **Response rates** (also known as objective response rate) - the proportion of people with partial response (decrease in tumour size) or complete response (disappearance of all signs of cancer) @nih_national_cancer_institute_nci_nci_nodate
* **Duration of response** - "time from randomisation to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response" @delgado_clinical_2021
* **Adverse events (AEs) of treatment** - "undesired effect" of treatment @nih_national_cancer_institute_nci_nci_nodate
* **Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)** - "the impact a medical condition and/or treatment has on a patientâ€™s functioning and well-being" @york_health_economics_consortium_quality_2016

The review identified 24 RCTs to include (plus an additional 6, but these were ongoing). All 24 studies recorded OS, PFS, response rate and adverse events, whilst other outcomes were more sparsely recorded.

For more information, see section "3.1.1 Identification of systematic literature reviews and randomised controlled trials" and "Table 11 Outcomes reported by RCTs included in the review" in the Assessment Report. @lee_treatments_2023-1

### Network meta-analysis

The identified trials do not all include the same treatments, with each comparing different therapies head-to-head. To illustrate this, below are 1L network diagrams for PFS and OS, as based on Figures 16 and 17 in the Assessment Report. @lee_treatments_2023-1 These show which treatments were directly compared head-to-head: each circle represents a treatment, and each line represents a clinical trial.

Abbreviations:  ave, avelumab; axi, axitinib; cabo, cabozantinib; ipi, ipilimumab; lenv, lenvatinib; nivo, nivolumab; pazo, pazopanib; pem, pembrolizumab; sora, sorafenib; suni, sunitinib; tivo, tivozanib.](../images/network_diagram.drawio.png)

For our economic model, we need to understand the clinical effectiveness of each treatment for each outcome, relative to the other treatments. This is measured using **hazard ratios (HR)**, which are "a measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time". @nih_national_cancer_institute_nci_nci_nodate

In order to estimate the comparative effectiveness of interventions that may not have been compared head-to-head in a randomised trial, **network meta-analyses (NMA)** were performed. Two types of NMA were used:

* **Proportional hazards NMA (PHNMA)** which returns a single hazard ratio for each comparison, as it "assumes the relative effects of each treatment... remain constant over time"
* **Fractional polynomial NMA (FPNMA)** which returns a list of time-varying hazard ratios for each comparison, as it "allows the relative effects to change over time" @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_renal_2024

NMA were performed for:

* **OS and PFS** in the all-risk group, favourable-risk and intermediate- and poor-risk subgroups
* **Safety** for the all-risk group

These were used as follows:

* **FPNMA** was used for 1L efficacy
* **PHNMA** was used for 2L and 3L efficacy
* 4L efficacy was "derived from pooled third and fourth-line outcomes" @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_renal_2024

The evaluation committee preferred the FPNMA approach as the "flexible time-varying hazard ratios... provided a better, more plausible fit to observed short-term data". Also, the assumption of proportional hazards was violated for some 1L treatments. However, they used PHNMA for later lines due to limitations in the data available for those lines.

## Stage 2. Extrapolating survival data from real-world evidence

This stage aims to **extrapolate survival data from real-world evidence (RWE)**.

### Identification of RWE

A targeted search was conducted to identify RWE (i.e. observational studies describing outcomes in practice, outside of a trial setting). The search was for studies that included patients with aRCC and described at least one of:

* Treatment pathways
* Natural history of disease
* Patient characteristics

Of the 12 real-world datasets identified, only one was considered to be robust and relevant to the UK. This was Challapalli et al. 2022. @challapalli_1463p_2022 The owners of this dataset provided access to patient-level data.

For more information, see section 1.12 "Real-world evidence" in the Pathway Model Report @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_renal_2024 and 3.1.2 "Identification of real-world evidence" in the Assessment Report. @lee_treatments_2023-1

## Model diagram

EOM:RCC is designed to model up to four lines of treatment before best supportive care. A diagram of the model is provided below. There are ten possible health states:

* First line (1L) off or on treatment
* Second line (2L) off or on treatment
* Third line (3L) off or on treatment
* Fourth line (4L) off or on treatment
* Best supportive case (BSC)
* Death

<!-- This is based on the diagrams in the excel input sheet, and in the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) pathway model report, but created in draw.io -->

![Structure of the model and transition between health states](../images/eomrcc_transitions.drawio.png)

Transition between lines of treatment can be defined by either progression-free survival (PFS) or time to next treatment (TTNT). We are assuming good correlation between PFS and TTNT baesd on clinical advice and a publication provided by Logex. <mark>For Logex's RWE, TTNT is the only option.</mark>
