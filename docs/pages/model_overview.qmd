## Advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC)

### Stage

**Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)** is a type of **kidney cancer**. It is the most common type, accounting for over 80% of cases. The treatment strategy depends on RCC's location and stage. The stages of RCC can be defined as:

* Stage 1 and 2 (cancer is only in the kidney)
* Stage 3 (cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes)
* Stage 4 (cancer has metastasised, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body)

Stage 4 RCC is also known as **advanced RCC (aRCC)**.

### Risk

The risks are as defined in the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria. RCC can be defined as either:

* **Favourable-risk** disease/cancer/RCC
* **Intermediate- and poor-risk** disease/cancer/RCC

This then guides treatment decisions:

* Treatments for all risk groups (i.e. favourable, intermediate or poor) include "sunitinib, pazopanib, tivozanib or avelumab plus axitinib"
* Additional treatments for intermediate- or poor-risk cancer are "nivolumab plus ipilimumab, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, or cabozantinib" @national_institute_for_health_and_care_excellence_nice_cabozantinib_2024

## Model diagram

EOM:RCC is designed to model up to four lines of treatment before best supportive care. A diagram of the model is provided below. There are ten possible health states:

* First line (1L) off or on treatment
* Second line (2L) off or on treatment
* Third line (3L) off or on treatment
* Fourth line (4L) off or on treatment
* Best supportive case (BSC)
* Death

<!-- This is based on the diagrams in the excel input sheet, and in the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) pathway model report, but created in draw.io -->

![Structure of the model and transition between health states](../images/eomrcc_transitions.drawio.png)

Transition between lines of treatment can be defined by either progression-free survival (PFS) or time to next treatment (TTNT). We are assuming good correlation between PFS and TTNT baesd on clinical advice and a publication provided by Logex. <mark>For Logex's RWE, TTNT is the only option.</mark>
