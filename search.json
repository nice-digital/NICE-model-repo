    "text": "The Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM:RCC) is a platform cost-effectiveness model encompassing each decision node in the disease area for advanced renal cell carcinoma.\nIt has been constructed as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Pathways Pilot appraisal (ID6186, GID-TA11186) [1] and the appraisal of cabozantinib plus nivolumab (TA964) [2] (formerly ID6184, whilst in development).\nThe Pathways Pilot aims both at reducing the long-term resource requirements for appraisal within crowded treatment pathways and at assessing the feasibility of incorporating treatment sequences into decision making. The development of this model is described in Lee et al. 2024. [3]\nThis website provides …\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
