This is currently populated with inputs that align with the final appraisal document (FAD) for TA964/ID6184, which is the appraisal of cabozantinib with nivolumab for untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma. Some of the inputs have been redacted in the publicly available spreadsheet as they are either academic and commercial in confidence (ACIC) or relate to the confident patient access scheme (cPAS). Hence, this version does not contain confidential company data, confidential price discounts or company individual patient data and treatment sequence data. The model does now contain UK real-world evidence (RWE) data which was redacted at the time of the appraisal at the request of the UK real-world evidence (RWE) data holders.\nThe data in the excel workbook will be imported to R using the sheet named ranges. In R, a nested list will be created where the Name is the reference for each item and the Cell Range is the content of the list.\nTo illustrate how this works, this example works through the parameter which contains a list of treatments allowed for population 1.\nOn the named ranges sheet, row 184 has Name List_pop1_allowed and Cell Range =Lists!$BA$11:$BA$22.\n\nOn the Lists sheet, we can see the list of allowed treatments.\n\nThen, if we import the excel spreadsheet, we can view that same parameter within the nested list i.\n\n# Import the functions required\nsource(file.path(\"../../3_Functions/excel/extract.R\"))\n\n# Import the excel file\nexcel_path &lt;- \"../../1_Data/ID6184_RCC_model inputs FAD version [UK RWE unredacted, ACIC redacted, cPAS redacted].xlsm\"\ni &lt;- f_excel_extract(excel_path, verbose = FALSE)\n\n# Tidy the imported parameters\ni &lt;- c(i,f_excel_cleanParams(i$R_table_param))\n\n# View the parameter\ni$List_pop1_allowed\n\n [1] \"avelumab_plus_axitinib\"      \"axitinib\"                   \n [3] \"cabozantinib\"                \"everolimus\"                 \n [5] \"lenvatinib_plus_everolimus\"  \"cabozantinib_plus_nivolumab\"\n [7] \"nivolumab_monotherapy\"       \"pazopanib\"                  \n [9] \"sunitinib\"                   \"tivozanib\"",

    "text": "Background\n\nRenal cell carnioma stages and risk groups\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer. It is the most common type, accounting for over 80% of cases. The treatment strategy depends on RCC’s location and stage. The stages of RCC can be defined as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 1 and 2\nStage 3\nStage 4\n\n\n\n\nCancer is only in the kidney\nCancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes\nCancer has metastasised, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body; Also known as advanced RCC (aRCC)\n\n\n\nPeople with aRCC who have not yet received systemic treatments (therapies that target cancer cells throughout the body) are classified as either being favourable-risk RCC or intermediate- and poor-risk RCC. These categories are defined in the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria. They are established based on time from diagnosis, the patient’s ability to perform daily tasks, and some laboratory measurements. In the UK, most RCC patients are classified as intermediate or poor risk. Risk status is associated with clinical outcomes (for example, mortality rates). It is used to help guide decisions on which treatments to use.\nFor more information, see section 2.2 “Epidemiology” and 2.3.1 “Risk Status” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nFocus of the appraisal\nThe analysis in this repository is related to the NICE appraisal TA964 [2] which assesses the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib with nivolumab as a first-line therapy for patients with aRCC.\nThis treatment is a combination of:\n\nCabozantinib - oral, 40mg daily\nNivolumab - intravenous, 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks\n\nIt is a first-line (1L) systemic therapy, meaning it is for previously untreated patients. They may then have up to 3 more treatments (referred to as second-line (2L), third-line (3L) and fourth-line (4L) therapies), or at any point, may instead transition to receiving best-supportive care (BSC).\nThe appraisal compares this treatment against other 1L treatments. When modelling this, it includes a simulation of the subsequent treatments that people might receive after each.\nFor more information, see section 3.2 “Interventions” and 3.3 “The RCC treatment pathway” in the Assessment Report.

Estimating the relative efficacy of each treatment\n\n\n\nExcerpt from overview diagram for Stage 1\n\n\n\nIdentification of randomised controlled trials\nA systematic review was conducted to identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with aRCC who received any of the treatments under comparison - namely: cabozantinib plus nivolumab; pazopanib; tivozanib; sunitinib; cabozantinib; nivolumab plus ipilimumab; pembrolizumab and lenvatinib; axitinib; lenvatinib plus everolimus; everolimus; nivolumab; avelumab plus axitinib\nThe studies had to report at least one of the outcomes of interest:\n\nOverall survival (OS) - “time from randomisation to death” [3]\nProgression-free survival (PFS) - “time from randomisation until first evidence of disease progression or death” [3]\nTime to next treatment (TTNT) - “time from initiating treatment to initiating the next line of therapy” [3]\nTime on treatment - similar to TTNT, but excluding time off treatment between lines of therapy\nResponse rates (also known as objective response rate) - the proportion of people with partial response (decrease in tumour size) or complete response (disappearance of all signs of cancer) [4]\nDuration of response - “time from randomisation to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response” [3]\nAdverse events (AEs) of treatment - “undesired effect” of treatment [4]\nHealth-related quality of life (HRQoL) - “the impact a medical condition and/or treatment has on a patient’s functioning and well-being” [5]\n\nThe review identified 24 RCTs to include (plus an additional 6, but these were ongoing). All 24 studies recorded OS, PFS, response rate and adverse events, whilst other outcomes were more sparsely recorded.\nFor more information, see section “3.1.1 Identification of systematic literature reviews and randomised controlled trials” and “Table 11 Outcomes reported by RCTs included in the review” in the Assessment Report [1] and section 1.8 “Literature review approach” in the Pathway Model Report. [6]\n\n\nNetwork meta-analysis\nThe identified trials do not all include the same treatments, with each comparing different therapies head-to-head. To illustrate this, below are 1L network diagrams for PFS and OS, as based on Figures 16 and 17 in the Assessment Report. [1] These show which treatments were directly compared head-to-head: each circle represents a treatment, and each line represents a clinical trial.\n\n\n\n1L network diagrams for PFS and OS, as adapted from the Assessment Report. Abbreviations: ave, avelumab; axi, axitinib; cabo, cabozantinib; ipi, ipilimumab; lenv, lenvatinib; nivo, nivolumab; pazo, pazopanib; pem, pembrolizumab; sora, sorafenib; suni, sunitinib; tivo, tivozanib.\n\n\nFor our economic model, we need to understand the clinical effectiveness of each treatment for each outcome, relative to the other treatments. This is measured using hazard ratios (HR), which are “a measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time”. [4]\nIn order to estimate the comparative effectiveness of interventions that may not have been compared head-to-head in a randomised trial, network meta-analyses (NMA) were performed. Two types of NMA were used:\n\nProportional hazards NMA (PH NMA) which returns a single hazard ratio for each comparison, as it “assumes the relative effects of each treatment… remain constant over time”\nFractional polynomial NMA (FP NMA) which returns a list of time-varying hazard ratios for each comparison, as it “allows the relative effects to change over time” [6]\n\nFor each RCT, requests were made to the company that owned each trial’s data, asking for grouped survival data (in time intervals of 1 or 4 weeks), for used in the NMAs. If this was not received, then the published curves were digitised to estimate the grouped survival data.\nNMA were performed for:\n\nOS and PFS in the all-risk group, favourable-risk and intermediate- and poor-risk subgroups\nSafety for the all-risk group\n\nPH NMA and FP NMA were both conducted, but the chosen models used were:\n\nFP NMA for 1L efficacy - as the “flexible time-varying hazard ratios… provided a better, more plausible fit to observed short-term data” [6] and as the proportional hazards was violated for some 1L treatments. However, PH NMA was used for pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, as FP NMA produced implausible results.\nPH NMA was used for 2L and 3L efficacy due to the “sparsity of the available network and extreme results within the fitted models” [1]\n4L efficacy was based on 3L outcomes, applying the hazard ratio for the difference between pooled 3L and 4L outcomes\n\nFor more information, see section 1.16 “Relative effectiveness” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 4.3.5.2 “Calculation of relative treatment effectiveness” in the Assessment Report.

    "text": "Stage 4. Modifications to the extrapolations\n\nTreatment effect waning\nTreatment effect waning is when the hazard/survival for a treatment converges to the hazard/survival of the comparator. This was implemented at 5 years for 1L combination therapies that included an immuno-oncology (IO) treatment and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (for example, axitinib and avelumab). It was set at 5 years as that is when people stop having that therapy in clinical practice.\nFor more information, see section 1.22 “Treatment effect waning” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 4.3.5.3 “Treatment effectiveness waning” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nGeneral population mortality\nIf aRCC patients were projected to live longer than the general population, this was corrected (hence, ensuring the aRCC OS never exceeds the general population). General population mortality was based on an age and sex matched-profile (against the 1L all risk population) using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5.4 “Accounting for general population mortality” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nOverlapping curves\nA known limitation of partitioned survival analysis (which was used to extrapolate the RWE) is that it can produce curves where PFS lies above OS (which is impossible in real-life). Hence, in cases where this occurs, it was adjusted so that PFS &lt;= OS (and also, PFS &lt;= TTP).\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5.5 “Adjustment for curves crossing” in the Assessment Report.

For all grade adverse events, hazard ratios from an NMA in a cochrane review were used. The reference curves (i.e. the baseline adverse event risk in the model) were:\n\n1L - sunitib from Checkmate 9ER RCT\n2L and 3L - everolimus from CheckMate 025 RCT\n\nThis is with the exception of cabozantinib plus nivolumab, whose rates were based directly on Checkmate 9ER RCT data.\nFor more information, see section 1.24 “Adverse events” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 4.3.6 “Adverse events” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nUtility values\nFor each line of treatment, there was a:\n\nUtility value for patients who were progression free\nUtility value for patients with progressed disease\nUtility value for BSC\n\nThe values were sourced from prior NICE technology appraisals - TA645 for 1L and then adjustment to that based on TA498 for 2L to 4L. These were identified through a systematic search for published cost-effectiveness studies.\nUtility values were adjusted for age and sex using Ara and Brazier et al. 2010 [8] / 2011 [9] and the Health Survey England (HSE) 2014 dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote about values in probablistic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not possible to adjust utilities values in the probablistic models, as the interactions between age and sex would need to be accounted for, but Ara and Brazier et al. 2011 [9] do not report the variance-covariance matrix that would have described how the variations correlate with each other. Varying age and sex separately could lead to spurious results or inference due to non-linear interactions between the parameters (some of which are transformed).\n\n\n\nFor more information, see sections 1.25 “Health-related quality of life” and 1.26 “Source of utility values” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and sections 4.1 “Published cost-effectiveness studies” and 4.3.7 “Utility values” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nResource use and costs\nSimilar to the utility values, resource use was based on prior NICE technology appraisals, whilst costs were based on NHS reference costs and costs from the Personal Social Services Research Unit. These include estimates of resource use and costs for:\n\nDisease management/health state (i.e. consultant and specialist nurse visits, CT scans, blood tests, pain medication)\nEnd of life (i.e. GP appointments, district nursing care, social care, hospital care)\nDrug and administration (i.e. costs of each drug)\nAdverse events (e.g. Grade 1/2 events like diarrehoea or fatigue, and Grade 3+ events like anaemia, hypertension and nausea)\nSubsequent treatment (i.e. radiotherapy, surgery)\n\nFor more information, see section 4.3.8 “Resource use and costs” in the Assessment Report [1] and sections 1.27 “Resource use” and 1.28 “Relative dose intensity” in the Pathway Model Report. [6]\n\n\nTreatment sequences\nA list of possible treatment sequences was defined based on rules which were established based on clinical advice and routine commissioning rules. These rules are listed in section 4.3.5.6 “Calculation of final outcomes by first line treatment” in the Assessment Report. [1] Some examples include:\n\nNivolumab plus ipilimumab 1L is only available to intermediate/poor risk patients\nSome therapies can’t be used if an immuno-oncology treatment was used in the past year\nLenvatinib plus everolimus can only be used after a prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment\n\n\n\nProportion of people receiving each treatment in practice\nThe proportion of people receiving each treatment in the model is based on the observed practices in the RWE.\nFor more information, see section 4.3.1.8 “EAG model structure” in the Assessment Report [1] and section 1.23 “Sequencing subsequent treatments” in the Pathway Model Report.

    "text": "Renal cell carcinoma Pathways Pilot (ID6186, GID-TA11186)\nIn 2022, NICE announced a programme aimed at taking a “proportionate approach to technology appraisals” (PATT). In the first phase of the programme, they “simplified, removed, or reconfigured parts of the appraisals process”. This was to enable the production of rapid guidance for simpler low-risk decisions by allowing “light-touch, faster evaluations” for those topics. In the second phase of the programme, they have been exploring several other ways of working, one of which being to take a “pathways approach to technology appraisals.” [1]\nThe pathways approach involves the production of a reusable platform/reference model for each disease area. The rationale for this that many NICE appraisals are in only a few disease areas, with almost half of health technology assessments within ten disease areas. Hence, developing a single reference model for each disease area should help “reduce repetition and improve consistency in decision making”. [2]\nIn their analysis plan, Lee et al. 2023 [3] emphasise the importance of these models being open-source so they can be reused and maintained without restriction. They give the example of the Innovation and Value Initiative (IVI) Open-Source Value project which started in 2018 and has since produced three disease models which are freely shared on their GitHub. [3] Each of these models are developed in R, with the first two being R packages with hosted documentation and supporting web applications (created with a commercial organisation, https://clarityviz.com/):\n\nNon-small cell lung cancer - GitHub, documentation, basic web app, advanced web app (note: these web apps are not working currently)\nRheumatoid arthritis - GitHub, documentation, model interface (advanced app), value tool (basic app)\nMajor depressive disorder - GitHub\n\nThe NICE pilot of the pathways approach was in renal cell carcinoma (ID6186, GID-TA11186). [4] This pilot was the Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM:RCC), as described and presented in this repository. In 2024, Lee et al. published an article describing their experience of developing this model (see publication page). [2] A final report from NICE on the pilot will be released in 2024/25. [1]",

These studies measured outcomes like how long people survived, whether their cancer progressed, and how well their cancer responded to the treatments. The studies also looked at side effects and how the treatments impacted patients’ quality of life.\nSome treatments were not directly compared in head-to-head trials. For example, cabozantinib and pazopanib were both compared to another drug, sunitinib, in separate studies, but not directly against each other (A).\nIn these cases, a method called “network meta-analysis” can be used to estimate how two treatments might have compared to one another, if they had been included head-to-head in a trial in real life. For example, estimating the effectiveness of cabozantinib versus pazopanib, based on what is known from their seperate comparisons with sunitinib (B).\n\n\n\nNetwork meta-analysis example",
