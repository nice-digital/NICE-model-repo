    "text": "Renal cell carcinoma Pathways Pilot (ID6186, GID-TA11186)\nIn 2022, NICE announced a programme aimed at taking a “proportionate approach to technology appraisals” (PATT). In the first phase of the programme, they “simplified, removed, or reconfigured parts of the appraisals process”. This was to enable the production of rapid guidance for simpler low-risk decisions by allowing “light-touch, faster evaluations” for those topics. In the second phase of the programme, they have been exploring several other ways of working, one of which being to take a “pathways approach to technology appraisals.” [1]\nThe pathways approach involves the production of a reusable platform/reference model for each disease area. The rationale for this that many NICE appraisals are in only a few disease areas, with almost half of health technology assessments within ten disease areas. Hence, developing a single reference model for each disease area should help “reduce repetition and improve consistency in decision making”. [2]\nIn their analysis plan, Lee et al. 2023 [3] emphasise the importance of these models being open-source so they can be reused and maintained without restriction. They give the example of the Innovation and Value Initiative (IVI) Open-Source Value project which started in 2018 and has since produced three disease models which are freely shared on their GitHub. [3] Each of these models are developed in R, with the first two being R packages with hosted documentation and supporting web applications (created with a commercial organisation, https://clarityviz.com/):\n\nNon-small cell lung cancer - GitHub, documentation, basic web app, advanced web app (note: these web apps are not working currently)\nRheumatoid arthritis - GitHub, documentation, model interface (advanced app), value tool (basic app)\nMajor depressive disorder - GitHub\n\nThe NICE pilot of the pathways approach was in renal cell carcinoma (ID6186, GID-TA11186). [4] This pilot was the Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM:RCC), as described and presented in this repository. In 2024, Lee et al. published an article describing their experience of developing this model (see publication page). [2] A final report from NICE on the pilot will be released in 2024/25. [1]",

    "text": "Background\n\nRenal cell carnioma stages and risk groups\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer. It is the most common type, accounting for over 80% of cases. The treatment strategy depends on RCC’s location and stage. The stages of RCC can be defined as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 1 and 2\nStage 3\nStage 4\n\n\n\n\nCancer is only in the kidney\nCancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes\nCancer has metastasised, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body; Also known as advanced RCC (aRCC)\n\n\n\nPeople with aRCC who have not yet received systemic treatments (therapies that target cancer cells throughout the body) are classified as either being favourable-risk RCC or intermediate- and poor-risk RCC. These categories are defined in the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria. They are established based on time from diagnosis, the patient’s ability to perform daily tasks, and some laboratory measurements. In the UK, most RCC patients are classified as intermediate or poor risk. Risk status is associated with clinical outcomes (for example, mortality rates). It is used to help guide decisions on which treatments to use.\nFor more information, see section 2.2 Epidemiology and 2.3.1 Risk Status in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nFocus of the appraisal\nThe analysis in this repository is related to the NICE appraisal TA964 [2] which assesses the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib with nivolumab as a first-line therapy for patients with aRCC.\nThis treatment is a combination of:\n\nCabozantinib - oral, 40mg daily\nNivolumab - intravenous, 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks\n\nIt is a first-line (1L) systemic therapy, meaning it is for previously untreated patients. They may then have up to 3 more treatments (referred to as second-line (2L), third-line (3L) and fourth-line (4L) therapies), or at any point, may instead transition to receiving best-supportive care (BSC).\nThe appraisal compares this treatment against other 1L treatments. When modelling this, it includes a simulation of the subsequent treatments that people might receive after each.\nFor more information, see section 3.2 Interventions and 3.3 The RCC treatment pathway in the Assessment Report.

    "text": "Stage 1. Estimating the relative efficacy of each treatment\n\nIdentification of randomised controlled trials\nA systematic review was conducted to identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with aRCC who received any of the treatments under comparison - namely: cabozantinib plus nivolumab; pazopanib; tivozanib; sunitinib; cabozantinib; nivolumab plus ipilimumab; pembrolizumab and lenvatinib; axitinib; lenvatinib plus everolimus; everolimus; nivolumab; avelumab plus axitinib\nThe studies had to report at least one of the outcomes of interest:\n\nOverall survival (OS) - “time from randomisation to death” [3]\nProgression-free survival (PFS) - “time from randomisation until first evidence of disease progression or death” [3]\nTime to next treatment (TTNT) - “time from initiating treatment to initiating the next line of therapy” [3]\nTime on treatment - similar to TTNT, but excluding time off treatment between lines of therapy\nResponse rates (also known as objective response rate) - the proportion of people with partial response (decrease in tumour size) or complete response (disappearance of all signs of cancer) [4]\nDuration of response - “time from randomisation to disease progression or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response” [3]\nAdverse events (AEs) of treatment - “undesired effect” of treatment [4]\nHealth-related quality of life (HRQoL) - “the impact a medical condition and/or treatment has on a patient’s functioning and well-being” [5]\n\nThe review identified 24 RCTs to include (plus an additional 6, but these were ongoing). All 24 studies recorded OS, PFS, response rate and adverse events, whilst other outcomes were more sparsely recorded.\nFor more information, see section “3.1.1 Identification of systematic literature reviews and randomised controlled trials” and “Table 11 Outcomes reported by RCTs included in the review” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nNetwork meta-analysis\nThe identified trials do not all include the same treatments, with each comparing different therapies head-to-head. To illustrate this, below are 1L network diagrams for PFS and OS, as based on Figures 16 and 17 in the Assessment Report. [1] These show which treatments were directly compared head-to-head: each circle represents a treatment, and each line represents a clinical trial.\n\n\n\n1L network diagrams for PFS and OS, as adapted from the Assessment Report. Abbreviations: ave, avelumab; axi, axitinib; cabo, cabozantinib; ipi, ipilimumab; lenv, lenvatinib; nivo, nivolumab; pazo, pazopanib; pem, pembrolizumab; sora, sorafenib; suni, sunitinib; tivo, tivozanib.\n\n\nFor our economic model, we need to understand the clinical effectiveness of each treatment for each outcome, relative to the other treatments. This is measured using hazard ratios (HR), which are “a measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time”. [4]\nIn order to estimate the comparative effectiveness of interventions that may not have been compared head-to-head in a randomised trial, network meta-analyses (NMA) were performed. Two types of NMA were used:\n\nProportional hazards NMA (PHNMA) which returns a single hazard ratio for each comparison, as it “assumes the relative effects of each treatment… remain constant over time”\nFractional polynomial NMA (FPNMA) which returns a list of time-varying hazard ratios for each comparison, as it “allows the relative effects to change over time” [6]\n\nFor each RCT, requests were made to the company that owned each trial’s data, asking for grouped survival data (in time intervals of 1 or 4 weeks), for used in the NMAs. If this was not received, then the published curves were digitised to estimate the grouped survival data.\nNMA were performed for:\n\nOS and PFS in the all-risk group, favourable-risk and intermediate- and poor-risk subgroups\nSafety for the all-risk group\n\nPHNMA and FPNMA were both conducted, but the chosen models used were:\n\nFPNMA for 1L efficacy - as the “flexible time-varying hazard ratios… provided a better, more plausible fit to observed short-term data” [6] and as the proportional hazards was violated for some 1L treatments. However, PHNMA was used for pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, as FPNMA produced implausible results.\nPHNMA was used for 2L and 3L efficacy due to the “sparsity of the available network and extreme results within the fitted models” [1]\n4L efficacy was based on 3L outcomes, applying the hazard ratio for the difference between pooled 3L and 4L outcomes\n\nFor more information, see section 1.16 “Relative effectiveness” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 4.3.5.2 “Calculation of relative treatment effectiveness” in the Assessment Report.

Extrapolating survival curves from real-world evidence\n\nIdentification of RWE\nA targeted search was conducted to identify RWE (i.e. observational studies describing outcomes in practice, outside of a trial setting). The search was for studies that included patients with aRCC and described at least one of:\n\nTreatment pathways\nNatural history of disease\nPatient characteristics\n\nOf the 12 real-world datasets identified, only one was considered to be robust and relevant to the UK. This was Challapalli et al. 2022. [7] The owners of this dataset provided access to patient-level data.\nFor more information, see section 1.12 “Real-world evidence” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 3.1.2 “Identification of real-world evidence” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nExtrapolation of RWE\nThe OS, PFS, time to discontinuation (TTD), time to progression (TTP) and post-progression survival (PPS) survival curves from Challapalli et al. 2022 [7] were extrapolated so that they covered the time horizon of the economic model, which was 40 years. Extrapolation was conducted using survival analysis (with a partitioned survival model).\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5.1 “Extrapolation of survival curves” in the Assessment Report. [1]",

Applying NMA hazard ratios to RWE reference curves\n\nReference curves\nFor 1L, the reference treatment used was sunitinib as it:\n\nIt is used in UK practice for all risk groups\nIt was the most common 1L treatment in the RWE\nWas the comparator for the most of the RCTs (see the network diagram above)\n\nFor 2L and 3L, the reference treatment used was cabozantinib as:\n\nIt was the most common 2L and 3L treatment in the RWE\n“Data were mature compared to other treatments” [1]\n\nThe reference treatment was based on RWE as per recommendations from the NICE manual and other recent appraisals.\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5 “Treatment effectiveness and extrapolation” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nApplying the hazard ratios to the reference curves\nThe effectiveness of 1L sunitinib and 2L cabozantinib is provided by the RWE reference curves. For all other treatments, the effectiveness is calculated by applying the NMA HRs to the reference curves.\nThe source of the HRs for each treatment, line and outcome were as follows:\n\nPFS and OS from the NMA - FPNMA for 1L (with exception of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib) and PHNMA for 2L and 3L\nAssume 1L pazopanib and tivozanib effectiveness are the same as sunitinib (as not available in NMA)\nAssume 2L/3L sunitinib and pazopanib effectiveness are the same as tizovanib (as not available in NMA)\nAssume 1L TTD and TTP are the same as PFS\nAssume 2L/3L TTP is the same as PFS, but for TTD apply a hazard ratio to the PFS, as calculated from the 1L treatments\nCalculate 4L outcomes by applying hazard ratio on 3L outcomes\n\nIn the code, the nested list containing the HRs and survival times for each treatment is referred to as a relative efficacy network, and when the hazard ratios are applied to the reference curve, this was described as propagating the network.\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5.2 “Calculation of relative treatment effectiveness” in the Assessment Report.

    "text": "Stage 4. Modifications to the extrapolations\n\nTreatment effect waning\nTreatment effect waning is when the hazard/survival for a treatment converges to the hazard/survival of the comparator. This was implemented at 5 years for 1L combination therapies that included an immuno-oncology (IO) treatment and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (for example, axitinib and avelumab). It was set at 5 years as that is when people stop having that therapy in clinical practice.\nFor more information, see section 1.22 “Treatment effect waning” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 4.3.5.3 “Treatment effectiveness waning” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nGeneral population mortality\nIf aRCC patients were projected to live longer than the general population, this was corrected (hence, ensuring the aRCC OS never exceeds the general population). General population mortality was based on an age and sex matched-profile (against the 1L all risk population) using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5.4 “Accounting for general population mortality” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nOverlapping curves\nA known limitation of partitioned survival analysis (which was used to extrapolate the RWE) is that it can produce curves where PFS lies above OS (which is impossible in real-life). Hence, in cases where this occurs, it was adjusted so that PFS &lt;= OS (and also, PFS &lt;= TTP).\nFor more information, see section 4.3.5.5 “Adjustment for curves crossing” in the Assessment Report.

Preparation of other data for the economic models\n\nAdverse events\nAs for the effectiveness outcomes from the NMA, the adverse events hazard ratios from the adverse event NMA were applied to reference curves. These reference curves (i.e. the baseline adverse event risk in the model) were:\n\n1L - sunitib from Checkmate 9ER RCT\n2L and 3L - everolimus from CheckMate 025 RCT\n\nAs mentioned, adverse event rates were estimated by applying NMA HR to these curves, with the exception of cabozantinib plus nivolumab, whose rates were based directly on Checkmate 9ER RCT data.\nFor more information, see section 1.24 “Adverse events” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and 4.3.6 “Adverse events” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nUtility values\nFor each line of treatment, there was a:\n\nUtility value for patients who were progression free\nUtility value for patients with progressed disease\nUtility value for BSC\n\nThe values were sourced from prior NICE technology appraisals - TA645 for 1L and then adjustment to that based on TA498 for 2L to 4L. These were identified through a systematic search for published cost-effectiveness studies.\nFor more information, see sections 1.25 “Health-related quality of life” and 1.26 “Source of utility values” in the Pathway Model Report [6] and sections 4.1 “Published cost-effectiveness studies” and 4.3.7 “Utility values” in the Assessment Report. [1]\n\n\nResource use and costs\nSimilar to the utility values, resource use was based on prior NICE technology appraisals, whilst costs were based on NHS reference costs and costs from the Personal Social Services Research Unit. These include estimates of resource use and costs for:\n\nDisease management/health state (i.e. consultant and specialist nurse visits, CT scans, blood tests, pain medication)\nEnd of life (i.e. GP appointments, district nursing care, social care, hospital care)\nDrug and administration (i.e. costs of each drug)\nAdverse events (e.g. Grade 1/2 events like diarrehoea or fatigue, and Grade 3+ events like anaemia, hypertension and nausea)\nSubsequent treatment (i.e. radiotherapy, surgery)\n\nFor more information, see section 4.3.8 “Resource use and costs” in the Assessment Report [1] and sections 1.27 “Resource use” and 1.28 “Relative dose intensity” in the Pathway Model Report.
