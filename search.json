    "text": "Renal cell carcinoma Pathways Pilot (ID6186, GID-TA11186)\nIn 2022, NICE announced a programme aimed at taking a “proportionate approach to technology appraisals” (PATT). In the first phase of the programme, they “simplified, removed, or reconfigured parts of the appraisals process”. This was to enable the production of rapid guidance for simpler low-risk decisions by allowing “light-touch, faster evaluations” for those topics. In the second phase of the programme, they have been exploring several other ways of working, one of which being to take a “pathways approach to technology appraisals.” [1]\nThe pathways approach involves the production of a reusable platform/reference model for each disease area. The rationale for this that many NICE appraisals are in only a few disease areas, with almost half of health technology assessments within ten disease areas. Hence, developing a single reference model for each disease area should help “reduce repetition and improve consistency in decision making”. [2]\nIn their analysis plan, Lee et al. 2023 [3] emphasise the importance of these models being open-source so they can be reused and maintained without restriction. They give the example of the Innovation and Value Initiative (IVI) Open-Source Value project which started in 2018 and has since produced three disease models which are freely shared on their GitHub. [3] Each of these models are developed in R, with the first two being R packages with hosted documentation and supporting web applications (created with a commercial organisation, https://clarityviz.com/):\n\nNon-small cell lung cancer - GitHub, documentation, basic web app, advanced web app (note: these web apps are not working currently)\nRheumatoid arthritis - GitHub, documentation, model interface (advanced app), value tool (basic app)\nMajor depressive disorder - GitHub\n\nThe NICE pilot of the pathways approach was in renal cell carcinoma (ID6186, GID-TA11186). [4] This pilot was the Exeter Oncology Model: Renal Cell Carcinoma edition (EOM:RCC), as described and presented in this repository. In 2024, Lee et al. published an article describing their experience of developing this model (see publication page). [2] A final report from NICE on the pilot will be released in 2024/25. [1]",

    "text": "Background\n\nRenal cell carnioma stages and risk groups\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer. It is the most common type, accounting for over 80% of cases. The treatment strategy depends on RCC’s location and stage. The stages of RCC can be defined as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 1 and 2\nStage 3\nStage 4\n\n\n\n\nCancer is only in the kidney\nCancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes\nCancer has metastasised, meaning it has spread to other areas of the body; Also known as advanced RCC (aRCC)\n\n\n\nPeople with aRCC who have not yet received systemic treatments (therapies that target cancer cells throughout the body) are classified as either being favourable-risk RCC or intermediate- and poor-risk RCC. These categories are defined in the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria. They are established based on time from diagnosis, the patient’s ability to perform daily tasks, and some laboratory measurements. In the UK, most RCC patients are classified as intermediate or poor risk. Risk status is associated with clinical outcomes (for example, mortality rates). It is used to help guide decisions on which treatments to use.\nFor more information, see section 2.2 Epidemiology and 2.3.1 Risk Status in the Assessment Report.\n\n\nFocus of the appraisal\nThe analysis in this repository is related to the NICE appraisal TA964 [1] which assesses the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib with nivolumab as a first-line therapy for patients with aRCC.\nThis treatment is a combination of:\n\nCabozantinib - oral, 40mg daily\nNivolumab - intravenous, 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks\n\nIt is a first-line (1L) systemic therapy, meaning it is for previously untreated patients. They may then have up to 3 more treatments (referred to as second-line (2L), third-line (3L) and fourth-line (4L) therapies), or at any point, may instead transition to receiving best-supportive care (BSC).\nThe appraisal compares this treatment against other 1L treatments. When modelling this, it includes a simulation of the subsequent treatments that people might receive after each.\nFor more information, see section 3.2 Interventions and 3.3 The RCC treatment pathway in the Assessment Report.",
