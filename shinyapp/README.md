# Shiny application

This folder generates a very basic shiny application which allows the user to select a few inputs and run some basic code related to the model.

It is hoped that this work can be further developed into a comprehensive user interface for people to interact with the model, instead of via the excel input sheet, but funding for this has not been confirmed currently.
