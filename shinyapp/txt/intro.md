The ambition for EOM:RCC is to create a shiny interface that allows users to interact and run the full economic model from a web application.

This is a **pilot example** of just one part of the analysis, which is to create a **table of possible treatment sequences**. This will vary depending on the treatments being considered, the included populations, maximum number of treatment lines. The included populations are:

* **Population 1:** Favourable risk and more than 1 year since immuno-oncology (IO) treatment
* **Population 2:** Intermediate/poor risk and more than 1 year since IO
* **Population 3:** Favourable risk and less than 1 year since IO
* **Population 4:** Intermediate/poor risk and less than 1 year since IO

The "favourable" and "intermediate/poor" risk statues are as defined by the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC).
