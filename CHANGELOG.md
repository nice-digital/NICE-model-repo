Merged modifications by Amy Heather made as part of the project [STARS (Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reproducible Simulations in healthcare)](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-eom-rcc).

### Added

* Documentation (`docs/`) hosted on GitHub pages
* Web application (`shinyapp/`) hosted on shinyapps.io

* `CITATION.cff` to provide instructions on how to cite the repository

### Changed

* Extended and improved details in README
* Add PenTAG email to licence
* Add `folder` input to `f_res_ProduceWordDoc()` to allow specification of the output folder to save the word document too (as previously hard coded `./4_Output`)

### Fixed

* Formatting of copyright statement in `LICENSE`

### Removed

* Removed unused template README and citation files from `1_Data/` `3_Functions/` and `4_Output/`. The paragraph that had been entered into the template README in the data folder was moved onto the probabilistic analysis page in the quarto documentation
